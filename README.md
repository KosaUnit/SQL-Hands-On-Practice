# SQL-Hands-On-Practice

Welcome to my step-by-step SQL journey! This repository is a collection of my SQL solutions to exercises, solved challenges, and projects built using real-world datasets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **[LeetCode-Problems](./LeetCode-Problems/)**: Contains SQL solutions to problems from LeetCode. Each problem has its own file, and the folder includes a dedicated README with more details.

<!-- More sections will be added as the repository grows -->
